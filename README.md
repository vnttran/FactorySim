# FactorySim
Developed using C++17 in Visual Studio. This project is a minimalistic tick-by-tick factory simulation that reads information from DAT files, assemble the product as ordered, and graphs the job flow network using GraphVIZ. 

This task was broken down into 5 Milestones. 

Milestone 1: Builds the CSV reader that takes in website data files. 

Milestone 2: Uses the CSV reader to read the task data. Once the CSV data is read, the data is parsed, printed and visualized by generating a GraphVIZ graph. 

Milestone 3: Read and processed item and order data files.

Milestone 4: Read all the data types provided through command line and verified all the task datas. 

Milestone 5: Putting the factory together.
